Tic-Tac-Toe game
Tic-Tac-Toe is played according to the following rules.

The game is played on a grid that is three squares by three squares.
Player one uses x's. Player two uses o's.
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.
If all nine squares are full and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

For Tic-Tac-Toe game files I used a version control system to develop my program. The version control system i employed was GitHub. I created a repository on Github called cse210-01 and copied the repository's url to clone it on VS code. This way, i was able to a save a copy of it in my local file. I Proceded to create a file called tic-tac-toe.py and saved it under the respository file. After writing the codes of the game, i committed it and then pushed it to my GitHub repository. This way, my work is saved on both sides. Whatever changes i made can also be staged and pushed to my GitHub repository.
